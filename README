DESCRIPTION
    This program will read a spreadsheet file and output one csv file for
    each worksseht in the input file. The name of each output file will be
    determined by the name of the input file and the name of the worksheet.
    For example, a worksheet "Sheet1" in a file called "reports.xls" will be
    output to "reports-Sheet1.csv".

NOTES
    Empty rows and columns at the beginning of a worksheet will be omitted.
    So if a worksheet has columns C through F filled, then the output for
    that sheet will have exactly 4 columns, not 6.
